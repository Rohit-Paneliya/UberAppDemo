# UberAppDemo

App functionality :

* User can select source and destination then after app will find the nearest route using Google Map Direction API and after that user will be animated from source to destination via Car icon.
* When user (car icon) rached the destination successfully, user will get the notification.(Notification Oreo 8.0 support).

Note: 

1) You can test this functionality only once or twice due to this limitation :

Reminder: To use our Maps, Routes, and Places APIs:
a) All Google Maps Platform API requests must include an API key; we no longer support keyless access.
b) You must enable billing on each of your projects.

**Even though after adding an API key, we must need to integrate billing account.Because of this reason, I didn't integrate billing account.**

Please refer this link: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/usage-and-billing

2) After user reached the destination successfully via Car icon, user will get the notification (Oreo 8.0 support).

3) Car direction is moving according to your requirement however car is moving too fast right now. I need more time to work on that Animation.
